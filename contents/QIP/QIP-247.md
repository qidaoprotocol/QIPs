## **QIP247: Onboard Aave V3 m.USDC to QiDao Metis PSM**

### Summary

Approve [Aave V3 m.USDC Token](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xea32a96608495e54156ae48931a7c20f0dcc1a21&marketName=proto_metis_v3) on Metis as collateral for QiDao’s peg stability module (PSM).

### Abstract

This PSM will allow users to deposit approved tokens to mint MAI natively on Metis, starting with Aave V3 m.USDC as an approved strategy. USDC on Metis will be accepted by the PSM and automatically deposited into this Aave strategy. The mechanisms will be the same as those on Base, Polygon PoS and Linea PSMs.

### Rationale

Metis chain presents challenges to QiDao’s unit economics, which results in relatively low access to MAI liquidity and limited usability for vault users, farmers and arbitrageurs.

Deploying a PSM on Metis addresses these issues by:

* Making sure users can always access liquidity by minting or redeeming MAI at a 1:1 ratio.  
* Reducing dependancy on DEX liquidity and minimising slippage.  
* Stabilising MAI’s peg on Metis through native arbitrage mechanisms  
* Improving market confidence in holding MAI and functionality of QiDao’s Metis deployment.

MAI on Metis remains isolated and it is a native-only stablecoin. While Metis currently has modest TVL and a limited supply of stablecoins, Aave’s m.USDC market with $2.96M total deposited and nearly $1M in available liquidity is a suitable option to support the protocol's liquidity needs. 

### Motivation

QiDao needs a PSM on Metis in order to stabilise its peg and ensure liquidity access, as already proven on Base, Polygon PoS and Linea. 

The tokens stored in the PSM will earn yield for the protocol. This yield will help offset the cost of capital associated with MAI tokens minted through this mechanism, as well as generate a new revenue stream for the protocol.

### Technical Specification

If this proposal is approved, a new PSM contract will be deployed with Aave V3 m.USDC as an approved strategy.

### Configurable Values

* Deposit fee: $0  
* Withdraw fee: Greater of $1 or 0.3%  
* Withdraw period: 3 days
